# Keylogger-with-Screenshot-Capture
This project is a Python-based keylogger that records keyboard activity and captures screenshots at regular intervals. It provides a way to monitor keyboard input and view what's displayed on the screen in real-time. The keylogger is highly configurable and offers the ability to customize screenshot capture intervals, the saving directory, and other options. This tool may be useful for educational and research purposes but should be used responsibly and in compliance with local laws and regulations.

## Key Features:
Logging of all user-entered keystrokes.
Capture of screenshots at configurable intervals.
Flexible configuration options for customization.
Secure storage of logs and screenshots in a specified directory.
Real-time data viewing.

## How It Works:
The program monitors keyboard input and logs all typed keys.
Screenshot capture occurs at predefined intervals, and images are saved in a specified directory.
Captured data is stored in log files for future reference.
